# Useful-Unity-MonoBehaviours
Repository of useful standalone monobehaviours

This repo is intended for game developers, containing many of the monobehaviours that I use in my own games. Currently, most of these functions are for 2D games. These monobehaviours perform a single function on attached gameobjects making them reusable across projects. Some of this code was written when I was a super noob, please forgive me. Project is built on Unity 2019.2.6f1 Personal but you simply import the scripts folder only. There is also currently 1 static class containing helper functions for GameObjects. The best way to figure out how to use each file is by taking a look at the code itself as each script is small. This repo will be expanded as I work on more projects. Script names are intuitive to their purpose.
